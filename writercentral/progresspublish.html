<h1> The Process of Publishing </h1>
<p> The process of publishing can be overwhleming to some as they don't know where to began
  on their own. One of the reasons why some people just go to a publishing company, because they can do all the hard
  work for you. However they can limit your freedom on what you want to write as well as
  take almost most of your profit your book has made. </p>
<p> So I have made these list of steps for you to take, after you finished up the manuscript, that gives you simple instructions. We also recommend
  reading these steps even if you want to send your book to us to get it printed and published out into the world.</p>

<h2> Step 1: Edit Your Book</h2>
<p> There are three ways to edit your book, most will say two, however there is three options.
  One of these options is having a professional edit your story, this is the most recommended option as
  they are an outside source and helping correct tone, grammar, spelling, plotpoints, etc. They use mostly line editing
  for this as this type of editing, espacially for fiction writers, is extremely benficial and can improve your story.
  However, it does cost money, so if you are on a tight budget, this route might not be for you. </p>
  <p> The second option would be having a family member, friend, or even strangers read your story. <a href="https://archiveofourown.org">AO3(or also known as Archieve of Our Own)</a>,
    <a href= "https://www.wattpad.com/home">Wattpad</a>,
    and other apps/websites like these help with either editing, improving, or even testing out your story to see
    if it would even catch interest of people. It is completely free and you can get some great results. But it may not
    be as accuarate as a professional editing and finding your errors. </p>
  <p> The last option would be you, yourself, going through and editing your story. It's a great opportunity to do
    last minute changes as well as catching typos and mistakes. The best way is reading it out loud, or reading it someone
    as you can catch more mistakes that way versus inside your head. </p>

  <h2> Step 2: Preparing Your Book For Publishing </h2>
  <p> This step is an easy step. All you have to do it create and eye-catching cover that
    can get your possible readers attention. People may say don't judge a book by its cover,
    however in this case making a book eye-catching and relating to your story is key. Just a bland red cover won't do it.</p>
  <p> The next thing you have to do is create a clean well formatted document to which it can help greatly
    for publishing on something like eBooks or any digital cite as it prevents wrestling with
    the computer computer. </p>
  <p> Last thing to this step is book formatting, this can really help your book become a book. </p>

  <h2> Step 3: Online or Printed? </h2>
  <p> Now this choice depends on how you want to reach your readers as well as your price range.
    It comes down to two choices, one being online and the other being printed. Now with online,
    or eBook is the most common, requires less money to do as you technically only publishing
    on copy of your book. However, your readers will also be looking at the price as they
    most likely will go for the $1.99 than one that is $10 or $15.</p>
  <p> Printed books are more expensive, espacially depending on the type of cover you want
    along with how many copyies you want to make. A hardcover will be more expensive than
    a softcover, reason why more books are softcovers instead of hardcovers. However you can sell it for more
    than you would with an eBook. </p>

  <h2> Step 4: Where To Sell Your Book </h2>
  <p> This step is simply which company or book store you want to sell your book on. You want
    to choose something that can reach out to millions of people and the cite or comapny being
    popular with books. Amazon is not one of these, however Apple and Google are.</p>

  <h2> Step 5: Marketing </h2>
  <p> This step can sometimes come before some even written their first word. This step all depends
    on your reviewsmon your books as well as metadata. Metadata is where you book is described, explains, and
    lists your book in bookstores. Both factors are impotant but it all depends on you as well as if you are selling
    your book online or printed. It can't be too high nor too low.<p>
