  <h1> Writing Tips </h1>
  <h3><em>Everyone needs some tips every now and then. Here are a few tips from grammar to getting out
  of writers block as well as improve your writing skills. </em></h3>

  <h2> Set Writing Goals </h2>
  <p>Setting up this goal can help you reach a set number of pages or words. It can help extend your chapters
  and provide more plot in them as well. But be careful, this can be a danegerous goal as sometimes you want to reach
the goal at any cost. </p>

<h2> Time of Day to Write </h2>
<p>For some people writing in the morning have an easy writing flow, not to mention cause less
gramatic errors in their writing according to Grammarly research. However maybe you found you write better
in the afternoon or when it becomes night. Choose a time of day that best fits for you.</p>

<h2> Inspiration </h2>
<p> One of the big negative elements that his authors is lack of inspiration. Gainging it back can be extrememly
  difficult and troublesome. However, it can also hit you in the oddest places. One of these can be research or even
  watching a random youtube video or animation. Inspiration can come from anywhere form a child chasing a dog
  to an anime you just started watching. So get out there and observe. </p>

  <h2> Outline </h2>
  <p> Outlining your story can greatly improve your writing. Having a plan how you want the story
    to come out can help keep you on track so you aren't going everywhere. You can create a powerpoint or even
    write it down in a notebook.</p>

  <h2> Be a Story Teller </h2>
  <p> Humans have been drawn to stories ever since ancient times. Your story doesn't have to be
    exactly resonable or if it can't happen in real life. However you can't go too above and beyond, or really
    too dramatic with the story. Keep is reasonable but at the same time have fun with it. </p>

  <h2>Avoid cliche </h2>
  <p> Look for overused adjective words along with overused phrases in your story. Change them
    to something more unique that you haven't written down a few times. Also avoid common actions
    in certain genre types. A big one is romance, come up with something new and not the usual you would find. </p>

  <h2> Keep a List of Often Mistakes </h2>
  <p> Find what your negative attributes in writing, or really your writing mistakes.
    If you write down the mistakes you commonly make you will most likely find them much easier. </p>
  <h2> Use Sensory </h2>
    <p> Using your five senses as you write and describe things in your writing can be very helpful for
      your readers as they picture what you are describing. However you don't have to describe everything by detail.
      For example, don't describe a toaster just say toaster along with its color if you want to. Unless your character
      doesn't know what a toaster is. </p>

    <h2> Become Your Character </h2>
    <p> As you write, place yourself in your character's shoes, or even imagine your standing where they are. This can
      help with sensory and description of what is going on around your character(s). </p>

      <p> These are some of the most important tips, but not all of them. Visit <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/writing-tips/">Grammarly</a> or
